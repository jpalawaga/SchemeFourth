(1a) A factorial function. The value you want to get the factorial of should be pushed onto the stack before calling:
FUNC factorial dup pop save 1 > LOOP DROP SAVE 1 - DUP POP * SAVE POOL DROP CNUF

(2)
Define these functions before starting the loop:
FUNC PRINT . CNUF
FUNC DUP2 swap dup pop swap dup save swap CNUF
FUNC compare DUP2 < IF DROP . "The greater value is " PRINT ELSE DROP SWAP . "The greater value is " PRINT SWAP THEN CNUF

Initialize the stack with three empty values for the loop:
1 1 1

Run the function:
50 < LOOP DROP DUP 80 < LOOP DROP 1 + DUP compare POOL DROP POP 1 + DUP DUP POOL
