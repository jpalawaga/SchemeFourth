1 to 50:

50 < LOOP DROP 1 +  DUP . POOL



50 < LOOP DROP 1 + DUP 30 < LOOP . POOL DROP POOL

A working nested loop:

10 < LOOP DROP DUP 10 < LOOP DROP 1 + DUP POOL DROP POP 1 + DUP DUP POOL

10 < LOOP DROP DUP 10 < LOOP DROP 1 + DUP DUP 3 > IF . ELSE THEN POOL DROP POP 1 + DUP DUP POOL

(1a) A factorial function. The value you want to get the factorial of should be pushed onto the stack before calling:
FUNC factorial dup pop save 1 > LOOP DROP SAVE 1 SWAP - DUP POP * SAVE POOL DROP CNUF
